   ```


4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   # Start both frontend and backend servers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Microphone Access Required"**
   - Make sure you've allowed microphone permissions in your browser
   - Refresh the page and try again

2. **"Browser Not Supported"**
   - Use Chrome, Edge, or Safari for best compatibility
   - Ensure you're using a modern browser version

3. **"Server Connection" Error**
   - Make sure the backend server is running on port 3001
   - Check that no other application is using the same port

4. **"API key not configured"**
   - Set your Gemini API key via environment variable or UI
   - Ensure the API key is valid and has proper permissions
